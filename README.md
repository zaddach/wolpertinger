This is supposed to be a lightweight (compared to full-VM emulations such as any.run) dynamic analysis tool for Windows executables.

The design was heavily influenced by [Qiling](https://github.com/qilingframework/qiling), an awesome framework for dynamic binary analysis.

This is a hobby project and heavily vibe-coded, be warned.

The project's name alludes to the mythical creature [Wolpertinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolpertinger) from the Bavarian Alps.
